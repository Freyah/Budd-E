	autonomous.c
-	!DONE edit turn functions for less and more turning speed - added timing to the robot_unit '
- 	!TODO figure out a way to make the robot turn fully around corners - need to adjust timing

	motor_directions.c
-	!TODO fix reverse controls; they are inverted: LEFT+BACK --> Reverse and right..
-	!TODO check pin directions in new functions

	robot_unit.ino
-	!DONE make camera swivel
-	!DONE finish adjustment settings;
-	!DONE add button for camera rotation start 								- needs test
-	!DONE swap joysticks around for camera control and robot control 		- needs test
-	!TODO add in an error state 
-	!TODO maybe remove reverse state;




--CHANGELOG--

********************
Version:	1.7
Date: 		02/06/2015
Editor:		Daniel 

Reduce corner speeds - reduce general speed
increase scanning frequency


********************
Version:	1.6.1
Date: 		30/05/2015
Editor:		Daniel 

WORKING

autonomous.h
-	Added adjusting type to state machine

robot_unit.ino
-	Edited to be less cluster-fucky and more organized; 
-	Added code segment to swivel the camera left -> right and reverse; need to start at the most-left position
-	Added timing for the 90 degree turns
-	Added linear timing (turns based on the distance from walls) for adjustments + check if adjustment has been made in the last second
- 	Disabled pinMode Output lines

control_unit.ino
-	Added separate control for the camera rotation; ROBOT joystick button toggles the camera rotation; sent via the byte out_buffer[4];

Version:	1.6
Date: 		30/05/2015
Editor:		Daniel 

autonomous.h
autonomous.c

robot_unit.ino
-	Added adjustment option; testing is not an option


********************
Version:	1.5.2
Date: 		28/05/2015
Editor:		Daniel / Edited at Uni:

Autonomous mode Works - No adjustments;
Forwards, Reverse, Stopped are working, turning at full speed works;

	
PWM settings - only between 1480 and 1520 for reduced speed and more precision
Made autonomous mode to work with Ports themselves rather than the setup_motor_pwm function - they are buggy for autonomous mode - reversed left/right wheels


********************
Version 1.5

Added files: autonomous.h autonomous.c 

autonomous.h
Contains declaration of the autonomous library. Types, etc.

autonomous.c
Function definitions - not finished

control_unit.ino
Updated formulas for 3 range sensors in control unit.
Changed if statement on line 155 to trigger on a low signal i.e. when the button is pressed.
Changed units in the rangeF rangeL and rangeR from mm to cm - divided by 10
Added proper software debounce for the toggle button.

robot_unit.ino
Added packets 3 and 4 in the protocol; Servo X position and autonomous state
Prepared for autonomous control - Added if else statements
toggle - WORKS
Added camera servo Timer 
Servo speed control is set up fully - WORKS


**********************

Version 1.4
Added first autonomous attempt
